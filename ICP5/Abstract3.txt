What these views have in common is that they are the explicit positions of the Democratic Party. In May, for instance,
a group of Senate Democrats reintroduced the Central America Reform and Enforcement Act, a bill designed to address the
root causes of migration  from Central America and to improve the processing of asylum claims at the U.S. border.
For the past two years, Democrats have also consistently  opposed the harshest policies of the Trump Administration,
from the travel ban to family separation,  while Republicans have largely remained silent.
