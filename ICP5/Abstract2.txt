Jonathan Auerbach, a statistician studying at Columbia University, analyzed rodent complaints made to New Yorkâ€™s 311
call system. His goal was to create a census of the rat population-not to become a footnote in Presidential politics.
His estimate of just over two million rats in the city would have been horrifying but for the long-held belief that
New York housed equal numbers of rats and humans, as if a municipal sponsor program had assigned each of the eight million
New Yorkers a muck-dwelling murine counterpart. The good news was that every four New Yorkers shared just one rat.
