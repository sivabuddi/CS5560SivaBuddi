At the U.S. border with Mexico, there are two overlapping policy problems for the Democrats. One is the actual situation there,
and the other is the response of the Trump Administration, which has made the situation worse by using the border crisis as a pretext to
increase detentions, intensify immigration enforcement, and dismantle the asylum system. There is no shortage of concrete policy proposals to
address the first problem. Last month, Representative Zoe Lofgren, of California, introduced a comprehensive bill to increase aid to Central
America, provide additional legal avenues for asylum seekers in the region, and improve the conditions at detention centers on the border.
